# Town Of Host: The Other Roles

## Regarding this mod

This mod is not affiliated with Among Us or Innersloth LLC, Town Of Host, and the content contained therein is not endorsed or otherwise sponsored by Innersloth LLC. Portions of the materials contained herein are property of Innersloth LLC. © Innersloth LLC.

I sometimes host this mod myself on Public Lobbies under several names such as **Whited**, **TOH-TOR**, and **TOH GOOD**.
I constantly update this mod and test it with randoms.

DISCORD SERVER: https://discord.gg/ha6XBCCHAN --- Recommended after Innersloth introduced randomized lobby names

## KNOWN BUGS

KNOWN BUGS:

- Lovers causes Severe Issues with the Game (fixed in update 0.8.4)
- Cat does just not work at all.
- Poisoner doesn't replace a Coven
- Some Roles have double their Cooldown or half their cooldown sometimes.
- Black screens on consoles when dead affter next meeting when impostors die. Desynced impostor roles can bypass this until they die. (Lag spikes triggered by name changes cause this)
- Sometimes players will see some or all players using desynced Impostor roles (known as Impostor Desync)
- Chat sometimes disappears for the host when a player leaves the game (this prevents commands from working until the host dies. Use SHIFT C ENTER or smth to force chat)
- Some or all roles disappear for ghosts in meetings, this does not apply to players with the mod
- If GA turns into a SidekickMadmate then the GA target dies, the GA turned SidekickMadmate will still turn into the role set in the settings for GA
- Unknown error/Reliable Packet for people that tries to join. It can be solved by using a VPN and connecting to the location that the host is (using mobile data works too)

## Features

This mod only needs to be installed on the host's client to work, and works regardless of whether or not other client mods have been installed, and regardless of the type of device.<br>
Unlike mods that use custom servers, there is no need to add servers by editing URLs or files.<br>
If you are going to play on Custom Servers, such as MNA and MEU, it would require everyone to have the mods the host has.<br>

However, please note that the following restrictions apply.<br>

- If the host changes and does not have this installed, the server isn't modded and is now just a regular Among Us game.<br>
- If someone with original TOH, joins a TOH: TOR lobby, they may experience graphical issues such as blackscreens.<br>

Note that if a player other than the host plays with this mod installed, the following changes will be made.<br>

- Custom Role Reveals
- Custom End Screens
- Additional settings
- Better UI
- etc.

| /myrole                     | Display your current role's description |

### Template
This function allows you to send prepared messages.<br>
Execute by typing `/template <tag>` or `/t <tag>`.<br>
To set the text, edit `template.txt` in the same folder as AmongUs.exe.<br>
Separate each entry with a colon, such as `tag:content`.<br>
Also, you can break lines by writing `\n` in the sentence like `tag:line breaks can be\nmade like this`.<br>

#### Welcome Message
If the tag is set to "welcome" in the template function, it will be sent automatically when a player joins.<br>
For example: `welcome:This room is using the mod Town Of Host: The Other Roles.`

### Impostor Disconnect Detection
If all Impostors leave the game, the game will automatically end with the unused Impostor Disconnected screen. This was done as all impostors leaving the game would black screen all players who do not use desynced Impostor roles after the next meeting.

### Developer Tag
Developers get a tag while in the lobby to indicate that they're a mod dev.
Below is an example:

#### Notes

Roles without a redirect mean they are not implemented yet but are planned.

### GM

The GM (Game Master) is an observer role.<br>
Their presence has no effect on the game itself, and all players know who the GM is at all times.<br>
Always assigned to a host and is ghosted from the start.<br>

## Impostor

### BountyHunter

Team : Impostors<br>
Basis : Impostor<br>

If the BountyHunter kill their designated target, their next kill cooldown will be much less than usual.<br>
Killing a player that isn't their current target results in an increased kill cooldown.<br>
The target swaps after a configurable amount of time.<br>

#### Game Options

| Name                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- |
| Time To Swap Bounty(s)                   |
| Kill Cooldown After Killing Bountys(s)    |
| Kill Cooldown After Killing Other(s)     |

### Camouflager

Team : Impostors<br>
Basis : Shapeshifter<br>

The Camouflager is an Impostor who can make every player shift into the chosen player for a limited time.<br>
Nobody can report a corpse while shifted.<br>

### FireWorks

Idea and created by こう。<br>

Team : Impostors<br>
Basis : Shapeshifter<br>

The FireWorks can set off fireworks and kill all at once. <br>
They can put a few fireworks by Shapeshifting. <br>
After they put all the fireworks and after the other impostors are all gone, they can ignite all fireworks at once by Shapeshifting. <br>
They can perform kills after setting off fireworks. <br>
Even if they mistakenly bomb themselves, killing everyone results in Impostor win. <br>

#### Game Options

| Name                |
| ------------------- |
| FireWorks Max Count |
| FireWorks Radius    |
